<h1>Legalese Contributor Licence Agreement</h1>

<p>Thank You for Your interest in contributing to Legalese, the online software application platform provided by Us at legalese.io (“Legalese”).</p>
<p>In order to clarify the intellectual property licence granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Legalese Pte. Ltd. (UEN: 201527692R, a private limited company incorporated in Singapore with its registered place of business at 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #05-16 Singapore 139951) (“We” or “Us”), must have a contributor licence agreement on each file that has been signed by each contributor, indicating agreement to the licence terms below.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contributor licence agreement (“Agreement”) is to clarify and document the rights granted by contributors to Us. This Agreement is for Your protection as a contributor as well as for the protection of Us; it does not change Your rights to use Your own Contributions (as hereinafter defined) for any other purpose.</p>
<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to Legalese. Save as expressly set out in the Agreement, You reserve all rights, titles, and interests in and to Your Contributions.</p>

<h2>Definitions & Interpretation</h2>

<p>"You" or "Your" shall mean the Copyright owner or legal entity authorised by the Copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution (as hereinafter defined) and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise; or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares; or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>
<p>"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship (software and/or documentation), including any modifications and/or additions to an existing work, that is Submitted by You to Legalese for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Work").</p>
<p>“Submit” or "Submitted" means any form of physical, electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Legalese or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Legalese for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."</p>
<p>"Copyright" means all rights protecting works of authorship owned or controlled by You, including copyright and neighbouring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including any extensions by You.</p>
<p>"Documentation" means any non-software portion of a Contribution.</p>
<p>"Material" means the software or documentation made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Material means the software or documentation to which the Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may be included in the Material.</p>

<h2>2. Grant of Copyright Licence</h2>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) Copyright licence to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licences or to grant sub-licences to third parties under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>publishing, modifying, and/or reproducing the Contribution in original or modified form;</li>
<li>preparing derivative works based upon or containing the Contribution and/or to combine the Contribution with other software code; and</li>

</ol>

<h2>3. Grant of Patent Licence</h2>

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licences granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

<h2>4. Outbound Licence</h2>

<p>Based on the grant of rights in this Agreement,, if We include Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right,</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Moral Rights. If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.</li>
    <li>Our Rights. You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.</li>
 </ol>

<h2>6. Disclaimer, No Warranty, and Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing by Us, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, whether express or implied, including without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, We, our affiliates, agents, directors, officers, employees, suppliers, and/or licensors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including damages for loss of profits, loss of revenues, financial losses, loss of goodwill, loss of use, loss of data, and/or other intangible losses, arising out of and/or relating to the use and/or inability to use Legalese.io, hacking, tampering and/or other unauthorised access or use of Legalese.io. This limitation of liability clause applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if We have been advised of the possibility of such damage. IF THIS CLAUSE 6 CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW, REVIEWING COURTS, MEDIATORS, AND/OR ARBITRATORS SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAW THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL CIVIL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.</p>

Such updates, revisions, supplements, modifications, and additional rules, policies, terms, and conditions (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Additional Terms") will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. Your continued use of Legalese following shall be deemed to constitute Your acceptance of any and all such Additional Terms. All Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p>
<p>The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.</p>
