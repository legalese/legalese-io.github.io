The execution and delivery of the Agreements by the Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations pursuant to the Agreements, and the issuance of the Shares and the Conversion Shares, will not result in any material violation of, or materially conflict with, or constitute a material default under, the Company’s Articles of Association, each as may be amended to date.</numbered_2_firstbold>
