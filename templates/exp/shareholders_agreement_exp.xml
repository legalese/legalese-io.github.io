<para_1>If a majority of the holders of Preference Shares and the common shareholders agree to a sale or liquidation of the Company at any time after 3 years from the date of signing of the Shareholders’ Agreement, the holders of the remaining Preference and Ordinary Shares shall consent to and raise no objections to such sale and, if required, sell their shares on the same terms.</para_1>

<a_left_sidehead xname="exp_drag_along">Drag Along – by majority decision</a_left_sidehead>

<para_1>If the holders of at least 51 per cent in aggregate of the Ordinary Shares and 2/3 of the holders of Preference Shares (the “Selling Shareholders”) wish to transfer the Shares held by them (the "Sale Shares") to an independent, bona fide and arm's length third party purchaser (the "Third Party Purchaser"), the holders of the remaining Preference and Ordinary Shares shall consent to and raise no objections to such sale and, if required, sell their shares on the same terms.</para_1>

<para_2>No Sale Shares may be sold to a Third Party Purchaser at a price which is lower than that specified in the Offer Notice; and so that, if the Selling Shareholders are proposing to transfer such Sale Shares wholly or partly for non-cash consideration, the cash value of such consideration for the purposes of this sub-paragraph shall (if not agreed by the Parties) be as reasonably determined by a firm of independent accountants, whose determination shall be final and binding on the Selling Shareholders.</para_2> 

<para_2>The Selling Shareholders may exercise the Drag Along Option by giving notice to that effect (a "Drag Along Notice") to all the Other Shareholders.  A Drag Along Notice shall specify that the Other Shareholders are required to transfer all of their Shares pursuant to this agreement to the Third Party Purchaser, the price at which the Shares are to be transferred, the proposed date of transfer and the identity of the third party purchaser.</para_2> 

<para_2>A Drag Along Notice shall be irrevocable and shall lapse if for any reason the Selling Shareholders shall not sell their Shares to the Third Party Purchaser within 60 days after the date of the Drag Along Notice.

<para_2>The liability of each Shareholder in such transaction is several (and not joint) and does not exceed the Shareholder's pro rata portion of any claim and the consideration to be paid to the Shareholder’s in such transaction will be allocated as if the consideration were the proceeds to be distributed to the Company's Shareholders in a liquidation under the Company's then-current Certificate of Incorporation. Each Shareholder shall indemnify the purchaser only to the extent of its own representations & warranties.</para_2>

<para_2>Completion of the sale of the Other Shareholders' Shares shall take place on the same date as the date proposed for completion of the sale of the Selling Shareholders' Shares.</para_2>

<para_2>Each of the Other Shareholders shall on the date of service of the Drag Along Notice be deemed to have irrevocably appointed each of the Selling Shareholders separately to be his attorney to execute any stock transfer and to do such other things as may be necessary or desirable to accept, transfer and complete the sale of the Shares pursuant to this agreement and after the Third Party Purchaser (or such person as he may direct) is registered as the holder of the Shares the validity of the proceedings shall not be questioned by any person.</para_2> 

<para_2>Restrictions contained in this Agreement in Schedule <xref to="exp_right_of_first_refusal"/> shall not apply on any sale and transfer of Shares to the Third Party Purchaser named in a Drag Along Notice.</para_2>

<para_1>No sale, transfer or other disposition of 50 per cent or more in aggregate of the issued Shares or of any interest in any of those Shares to a bona fide and arm's length Third Party Purchaser shall be permitted unless and until the Third Party Purchaser shall have offered to purchase all of the Shares in the Company held by members who are unconnected with the Third Party Purchaser (the "Remaining Members").</para_1>

<para_1>The offer to be made by the Third Party Purchaser shall be in writing and capable of acceptance by the members for not less than 14 days from the date of the offer.  The offer shall be deemed to have been irrevocably rejected by a member if that member shall not accept the offer in accordance with its terms, conditions and provisions and the specified period for acceptance of the offer.</para_1>
